Text-mining analysis of word frequency and sentiment of sermons on the Lord's Prayer

Thus Saith the Church: Analysis of Sermons Through Text Mining

The messages we hear shape the people we become, and this is especially clear in our religious communities. This study investigates differences in most important words and overall sentiment of sermon transcriptions from a sermon series on the Lord’s Prayer. Text mining is the process of analyzing text to find meaningful patterns (Silge & Robinson, 2022). Sermons are analyzed and compared through tidy text mining. The methods of text mining used include total word count and sentiment analysis, which categorizes words in a document and then extracts an overall sentiment for the text. This study found that sentiment of words may reflect the sentiment of the text that inspires it. Additionally, most used words may be useful for summarizing a sermon’s content when adjusted to account for words that a speaker uses most often.
